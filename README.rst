python XML Security
===================

This is a python implementation of XML-Security - XML-DSIG only right now. There are no
dependencies except lxml currently.

This code was inspired by https://github.com/andrewdyates/xmldsig (this implementation is
a refactor and extension of that implementation) and includes a pure-python RSA implementation
https://github.com/andrewdyates/rsa_x509_pem by and with permission from Andrew Yates.
